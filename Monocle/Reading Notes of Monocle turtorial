Workflow:
  Stpre Data in a CellDataSet(Monocle's main class)
  Classify cells with known marker genes(using knowledge of expression of certain genes, e.g. expression(MYF5) >=1 & expression(ANPEP) < 1)
  Cluster your cells
  Order cells in pseudotime along a trajectory
  Perform differential expression analysis(Can do lots of things by providing a comparing formula, e.g. "~Batch" to control batch effect and "~Media" to explore the effect of media)
  
The CellDataSet class(sometimes called CDS)
  Require three input files: (two main element: gene and cell. Numbers of genes and cells must be the same in each input)
    exprs(numeric matrix of expression values, rows are genes, columns are cells);
    phenoData(an AnnotatedDataFrame object, rows are cells, columns are cell attributes such as cell type, culture condition, etc.);
    featureData(AnnotatedDataFrame, rows are features such as genes, columns are gene attributes, such as biotyoe, gc content, etc. Must has a column called 'gene_short_name')
    # CDS can be imported from and exported to other packages like Seurat and Scran
