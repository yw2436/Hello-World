# Markdown syntex 
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. This file is the record of my learning of this.

There are two helpful links: https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf

https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists

## 1. Headers
We can set different size of headers using '#'s at the begining, for example:
# Largest headers
## Second largest headers

## 2. Emphasis
*single '\*' or '\_' in the begining and end means italic*

**double '\*' or '\_' in the begining and end means bold**

*also you can **combine** them*


## 3. New line
Hitting 'enter' in the raw text doesn't give you a new line,
like this

You have to use a blank line to get a new line

## 4. HTML
https://github.com - it automicly recognizes a link

[or you can give it a name, this goes to the github](https://github.com)

## 5. Lists(unfinished)
We can set ordered or unordered lists using numbers, '*', '+' or '-' at the begining. The actual numbers doesn't matter. And indention at the begining of each line gives the level.

Example 1:
1. one
1. two, actual numbers doesn't matter

   You can have a idented paragraph in a listed item, with a blank line above and below and 3 leading spaces

3. three
4. four

Example 2:
* one
* two
+ changing the symbols will start a new list
+ two
