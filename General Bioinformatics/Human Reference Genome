There are three main sources of human reference genome data: NCBI, Ensembl and UCSC. 
All resources use the same assembly but annotates differently. But during downloading, we must be caution about which assembly they are using. 

Normally, we are interested in reference sequence(.fasta) and annotation(.gtf)
###Better download the .fasta and .gtf from the same database, because they may use different name of chromosomes like 1 or chr1, chrUn_KN150713v1 or KN150712.1

.fasta  
  Soft-masked(_sm) or RepeatMasker(_rm)
    RepeatMasker masks repeat region with Ns, while Soft-masked repeat region is lower case.
  toplevel or primary_assembly
    toplevel文件中包含了所有的在ensembl数据库schema中被定义为toplevel的序列，包括:染色体, 未能组装到染色体上的区域, 含有N的haplotype/patch区域。
    primary_assembly文件相比于toplevel文件，减去了含有N的haplotype/patch区域。这类文件比较适合用来比对。
    
.gtf
